# PKN-Generator
Generates Prior Knowledge Networks using OmnipathDB and then processes them using CARNIVAL + GEX data. The goal is to better understand how signalling pathways in skeletal muscle are regulated during states such as exercise. This code was for my exchange to the Lab of Quantitative Exercise Biology at Simon Fraser University.

Set your work directory accordingly and run the wrapper script to generate a PKN of interest and process it with CARNIVAL. GEX, and perturbation data are necessary.
